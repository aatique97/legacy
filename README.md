# legacy, project 1
This is a translation (to Fortran 95) of a code originally written in Fortran 77. This was a project for the course Legacy Systems. 
The code only has one subroutine that calculates the fire danger index (how easy it is to ignite vegetation, how difficult a fire 
may be to control, and how much damage a fire may do).
